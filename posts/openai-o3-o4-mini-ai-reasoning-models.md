## Introduction to OpenAI's o3 and o4-mini Models

OpenAI has just rolled out two new reasoning engines—**o3** (the heavyweight) and **o4-mini** (its faster, lighter sibling). Both can “think with images”, run Python mid‑conversation, and call external tools, but o4-mini does it for about **1⁄10 the price**. Pair them with the new **Codex CLI** for terminal‑based coding help, or check out Anthropic’s **Claude Code** if you want deeper Git integration. Here’s the ultra‑short tour of these updates.

## Meet the Models

| | o3 | o4-mini |
|---|---|---|
| Super‑power | Deep chain‑of‑thought, 200k‑token context | 80–90% of o3’s brains, lower latency |
| Image skills | Reads diagrams, zooms/rotates to reason | Same vision stack, great with messy photos |
| Typical use | Big math, giant codebases, research agents | Everyday dev work, high‑volume vision tasks |

## Power vs. Price (why your CFO smiles at o4-mini)

- **o3:** $10/M input · $40/M output tokens  
- **o4-mini:** $1.10/M input · $4.40/M output tokens  

In practice, you keep roughly 85% of the capability for about a tenth of the bill.

## Where Each Model Shines

**o3 – the deep thinker**
- Crushes benchmarks: 71% on SWE‑bench‑Verified bug‑fix tasks, 95%+ on AIME math.
- Handles 200k‑token prompts—enough for an entire repo or PhD thesis.
- Runs Python while reasoning to test hypothesis and QA its own solutions.

**o4-mini – the cost‑effective sprinter**
- Same multimodal tricks, optimized for speed and price.
- Surprisingly robust with blurry, low‑light, or skewed images.
- Ideal for batch OCR, support‑chat summarization, and any “do this 10 k times an hour” workload.

## Codex CLI vs. Claude Code — two terminal coding tools

| Feature | Codex CLI | Claude Code |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `npm i -g @openai/codex` | `pip install claude-code` (private preview) |
| Speed | 2–3× faster iterations | Slower but “thinks harder” |
| Autonomy modes | Suggest ▸ Auto‑Edit ▸ Full‑Auto | Interactive ▸ Headless |
| Git magic | Basic diff explanations | PR creation, merge conflict fixes |
| Privacy | All code stays local; only prompts hit OpenAI | Local for terminal; browser tool runs JS sandbox |

### When to use each tool
Choose **Codex** for rapid refactors and local privacy; pick **Claude** when you need in‑depth reasoning plus advanced Git workflows.

## Try Them in Five Minutes

**ChatGPT UI**  
1. Plus/Pro/Team users: click the model picker and choose *o3* or *o4-mini*.  
2. Free tier: switch to *Think* mode to sample o4-mini.

**API One‑Liner**  
```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
 -d '{
   "model": "o4-mini",
   "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Summarize today\'s AI news in 5 bullets"}]
 }'
```
> Note: For API access of o3 you may need to submit some documents for verification. Check [OpenAI's official note](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10362446-api-access-to-o1-o3-and-o4-models) for more details.

## TL;DR

*Need raw brainpower?* Pick **o3**.  
*Need scale on a budget?* Pick **o4-mini**.  

Whichever you choose, pairing them with **Codex CLI** or **Claude Code** turns the models into hands‑on coding copilots.
